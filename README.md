- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LuisGerman99

Worked as an Intern Member of Honeywell in Quality and Metrology Dept. I am mostly focused 
on software developing in languages like Visual Basic for Applications, Python, LabView or Matlab. 
My main passion is robotics, programming and automation technologies. 

My engineer career started since bachelor's at CBTis21 where I studied as a mechatronics 
technician. I was a former part of the robotics club, Innobotics team #6694, where we 
achieved third place at the national competition FRC. FRC stands for FIRST Robotics Competition,
a worlwide event of robotics where bachelor's students have the chance to get into the 
robotics world.

As a graduated from bachelor, I received a scholarship from GULFSTREAM to be able to study in 
CETYS Universidad. Since then I participated in many tournaments and robotics competitions 
like line follower cars and innovation and design. I have been awarded five times with academic 
excellence for achieving an average of 98 or greater. 

I got a chance to be part of the HONEYWELL team as an intern. I am developed and applied
techniques for report automation and obtaining stadistics in Excel with the help of VBA Macros.
Data processing is a key in order to obtain stadistics to be able to wisely make decisions.
